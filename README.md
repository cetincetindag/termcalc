# termcalc
Terminal calculator app in Python

## Features:

> Input string processing algorithm for differentiating math operators and commands from numbers.
> Mild ASCII modifications for better looks and comprehension.
> Multiple file configuration to make future implementations/debugging a little bit easier.
> **UNDER CONSTRUCTION**: Advanced math functionality such as derivatives and trigonometric functions.

# Usage:

> "main.py" is constructed in a way that it only contains the initialization instructions (just a couple of lines), so running that file from your console by using "python ./main.py" or your favorite Python interpreter is all you need to do.
> You can edit the source files to suit your taste better (changing the output texts, adding functionality)
> The project is intentionally left as .py files for easier inspection of the code by viewers.

## Final Notes:

- I recommend every beginner/intermediate programmer like myself to build a CLI that focuses mostly on string operations as it really teaches you how to manipulate a string of data to match your specific needs.
- I am not really a Python developer (mainly C languages), so it was pretty fun to learn about all the string operations Python conveniently provides you with. It was extremely easy to code once I decided how I wanted to approach certain methods.

# DISCLAIMER:

- As I am not the best at using this language (basically first time), I cannot guarantee that any part of my code is a good interpretation of my intentions. Many of the operations performed in this code can possibly be inefficient, unneeded or overly complicating. I would greatly appreciate criticism in your preferred way.
